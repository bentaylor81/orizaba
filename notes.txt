# Add in the item_qty into the Order Table from the OrderItem table
# 'Time' field added to Order table. Needs to sync to Magento order time - time = models.TimeField(auto_now=False, auto_now_add=False, default='00:00:00')
# Renamed change Date to a FK which now needs to show the date in 2020-06-23 - YYYY-MM-DD format. Previously this was a date time. 
# Month and year from the Order table has been removed so can be unlinked from Magento.




### DONE ###



# Add filters for day to speed up query



# Regarding the updating when required. Could have a 'last updated' field in the date table. 
# Then say if latest order date time is > last updated field run the function (could be costly updating every field).
# Or could make an update stats table, which inserts a field with a datetime everytime the stats are run.
# Install debug toolbar

# Might be easier to use a class based view
# Setup 3 new tables - Date2, Month2 and Year2
